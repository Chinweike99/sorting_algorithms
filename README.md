#Learnt
- Different sorting algorithms
  - Bubble Sort: This repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
  - Selection Sort: It sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning
  - Insertion Sort: It builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms.
  - Quick Sort: It is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a pivot element and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
  - Merge Sort: It is an efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by dividing the array into two halves, recursively sorting them, and then merging the sorted halves.
  - Heap Sort:  It is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure to build a partially sorted array, which is then transformed into a sorted array.
  - Redix Sort: it does not compare numbers, data is to be sorted digit by digit starting from the least significant digit
  - Shell Sort: It is used to compare elements far distant apart, the efficiency of the sort depends on the gap sequence.
